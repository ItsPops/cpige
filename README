Usage: ./cpige -c path/to/cpige.conf
    -c path/to/cpige.conf.


=========== GUI ===========

A GTK2 GUI is now available for cPige 1.5.
To use it:

cd gui; ./configure && make

now, copy cpige binary somewere the GUI will find in PATH, then launch
cpigeGUI.

Enjoy :)

=========== Upgrading ===========
Prior to version 1.4, cPige uses command line options.
In 1.4, thoses command lines were removed, to leave the place
to a config file.

But cPige is back compatible. You should be able to use old command
line options, by compiling cPige with the NOCONFIG flag.

Example:

NOCONFIG=1 make clean all

Then cPige should work as prior to 1.4. (Note that new functionnalities comming
from 1.4 and more will not be backported to commandLine options, excepted
if this is a request of users.)
